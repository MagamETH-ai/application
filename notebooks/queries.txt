# Запрос выбирает все события аирдропов из таблицы airdrop.claims,
# произошедшие за последние 60 дней. Он нужен для анализа,
# какие токены и проекты реально делали раздачи, кому и в каком объёме.

SELECT

WHERE block_time > now() - interval '60' day


# Запрос находит кошельки, которые участвовали в нескольких известных аирдропах.
# Он объединяет данные из разных проектов (Uniswap, 1inch, ENS, DYDX и др.),
# формирует список уникальных адресов, и считает, сколько различных аирдропов получил каждый адрес,
# а также какие именно. В результате получается таблица активных пользователей,
# которые систематически участвуют в дропах — это потенциально ценные адреса для анализа поведения или таргетинга.
